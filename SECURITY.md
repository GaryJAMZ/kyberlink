# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

KyberLink takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly to **antoniogaribay6@gmail.com**.

**Important:** Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue to report security vulnerabilities. Public disclosure could allow others to exploit the vulnerability before a fix is available.

## What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a security vulnerability, please provide:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code (if possible)
- The potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggestions for fixing the issue (optional)

## Expected Response

You can expect:
- An acknowledgment of your report within 72 hours
- A timeline for addressing the issue
- Credit for the discovery (if you wish)
- Updates on the status of your report

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
1. We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
2. We will develop and test a fix
3. We will release a patched version
4. We will acknowledge the reporter (with permission)
5. We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after a fix is released

## Scope

Security vulnerabilities within the following areas are in scope:
- Gateway code and core protocol implementation
- Cryptographic implementations and key handling
- Protocol design and message validation
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Network communication security

## Important Note

**KyberLink is experimental software currently in active production.** Please be aware that:
- This project has NOT yet undergone an independent security audit
- Use at your own risk, particularly in security-critical applications
- While we take security seriously, the code should not be considered production-ready for all use cases
- We recommend thorough testing and review before deployment in sensitive environments

## Vulnerability Disclosure

Once a security vulnerability has been patched and released, we will:
- Publish a security advisory
- Credit the reporter (if desired)
- Document the vulnerability and its fix in release notes
